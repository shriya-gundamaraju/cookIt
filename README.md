# Cook It!

https://cook-it-streak.glitch.me/

This website randomly generates a recipe for you to cook based on your dietary restrictions and preferences! It's a fun way to encourage more people, especially college students, to cook for themselves and experience new foods.

## What is this project?

*This website is not fully functioning/complete*

My team and I wanted to create a website that encouraged other people to cook, learn, and experience different types of foods from around the world. This website makes it easy for anyone to find a recipe whenever they want. 
It filters recipes based on people's dietary restrictions and generates a random recipe so it is faster and easier to find a meal that fits their needs.

## How did we build this project?

We built it on Glitch using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

## We built this with Glitch!

[Glitch](https://glitch.com) is a friendly community where millions of people come together to build web apps and websites. 
We used code from https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/09/random-meal-generator, https://w3schools.com, and https://geeksforgeeks.com
